      <p>
        Habit 2: Begin With the End in Mind is based on imagination—the ability
        to envision in your mind what you cannot at present see with your eyes.
        It is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There is
        a mental (first) creation, and a physical (second) creation. The
        physical creation follows the mental, just as a building follows a
        blueprint.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don’t make a conscious effort to visualize who you are and what
        you want in life, then you empower other people and circumstances to
        shape you and your life by default. It’s about connecting again with
        your uniqueness and then defining the personal, moral, and ethical
        guidelines within which you can most happily express and fulfill
        yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best ways to incorporate Habit 2 into your life is to develop
        a Personal Mission Statement. It focuses on what you want to be and do.
        It is your plan for success. It reaffirms who you are, puts your goals
        in focus, and moves your ideas into the real world. Your mission
        statement makes you the leader of your own life. You create your destiny
        and secure the future you envision.

        Begin With the End in Mind means to begin each day, task, or project
        with a clear vision of your desired direction and destination, and then
        continue by flexing your proactive muscles to make things happen.

        “People are working harder than ever, but because they lack clarity and
        vision, they aren’t getting very far. They, in essence, are pushing a
        rope with all of their might.”
